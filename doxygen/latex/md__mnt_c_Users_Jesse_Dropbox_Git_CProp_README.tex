Lifting line propeller optimization routine using C.

For a long time now, mathematical procedures to optimize the efficiency of marine propellers operating input_ nonuniform ship wakes have been known. Several implementations of these procudures exist, notably Open\+Prop (written input_ M\+A\+T\+L\+AB) and Java\+Prop. However, Open\+Prop limits itself to single-\/stage propulsors, and Java\+Prop is mainly used for plane propellers.

This project aims to implement Coney\textquotesingle{}s (1989) optimization procedure for multi-\/stage propulsors, contra-\/rotating propellers input_ particular, input_ a single program. The eventual goal is to provide the complete propeller geometry, starting with a lifting line optimization program, and including 2.\+5D viscous flow analysis with X\+F\+O\+IL, strenght/vibration analysis, and cavitation analysis.

Most of the routines will be written input_ the C and C++ programming languages, with exceptions made for graphical applications.
